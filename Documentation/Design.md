## Modchip design overview
The modchip is controlled by a RP2040 microcontroller that triggers on the eMMC D0 line and creates two pulses with a (programmable) delay and offset for the MOSFET driver.
One of these pulses controls the glitch MOSFET, when the gate of this MOSFET is driven high the SoC core voltage supply will be shorted to ground. The second pulse generated by the RP2040 allows to control two MOSFETs that can enable/disable two capacitor banks. These capacitors are required for the UT to fully boot, but the capacitors banks cannot be enabled during the voltage glitch as this would prevent us from obtaining the desired fault.

The schematic and gerbers to produce your own modchip are provided [here](./pcb/).
